Hi, this is Terrence Mahon, Co-Founder and Head Coach of Golden Coast Track Club. Thank your for taking the time to visit our new website.

The Golden Coast Track Club, newly established in January 2020 is a rebranding of our former team, The Mission Athletics Club. On a day to day level not a lot has changed. We still call San Diego our home, we still have our core group of elite athletes and still have a goal of being successful in both in sport and life. We just wanted to spice it all up a bit. We hope you like it.

**WHY REBRAND?**

The reasons are many, but the easiest way to say it is that we wanted to create a new platform that makes it easier for us to connect with our fellow runners. Our goal for 2020 is to build a bridge that better connects the elite side of the sport with its audience. Our hope is that this interaction with our coaches and athletes will be like nothing else you can find in the running world. What you see now and in the future is that creation come to life.

Here is our plan. We are going to share with you what we really believe in with regard to all things running. You will get insights into the reasons why we run and why we love to compete. You will learn about our running ethos and how that carries through to all aspects of the sport. We also want you to have the opportunity to experience the training - our training, but for You. Experience for yourself all of the track workouts, the tempo runs, gym work and running drills. Experience the training how each and everyone of us do on a daily basis.

**WHAT’S NEW?**

Take a look at the front page of our site and you will see our new logo. It is an old school 1970’s era bus. It is a California icon that truly represents the golden coast. It symbolizes the sun, sand and sea. It reminds us that life should be enjoyed outdoors. It reminds us all that getting together with friends, going on a road trip and taking time to breathe fresh air is what makes life truly special. For us it means “Welcome”. We hope you feel the same. We welcome you to come ride with us into this new decade and renew your love of running.

**WHAT ELSE IS NEW?**

**Free Training Programs**. Yes that is correct - Free! We have written up training programs for the 5k, 10k, Half Marathon and Marathon distances. These aren’t just your run of the mill running magazine programs. These are designed by our knowledgeable coaching staff with years of training experience. These are quality programs worked on by our team and are versions of the very same training that we do. We have created three different options for each event. The most basic is designed to get you to the finish line and then the intensity ramps up from there so that if your goal is chasing a fast time we have got you covered.

**Paid Training Programs**. Alongside our Free Training Programs we are offering a paid version. These paid programs will go a long way in helping to fund our team. For most elites, the sacrifices made to try and make it to the top come at a big economic cost. We want to ease that burden so that our athletes can put as much time and energy as is needed to fulfilling their dreams. We are hoping that by offering up high quality training plans we can keep this club going for years to come and support athletes long into the future.

For a small fee we give you our training plans along with lots of extras. You will have weekly drill routines, weekly strength routines and an abundance of nutrition and mindfulness tips. The running programs will have specific paces spelled out so that you know what to aim for on all the runs and workouts. These will all be based on your racing goals so that you know that everyday has a purpose and everyday brings you one step closer to the goal. Knowing what to do each and every day is like having a pro coach right there with you at the track. You will be training just like our elites do. All you need is to pick a goal and then let us help you achieve it.

**Mindfulness**. Do you want to know how we approach the mental side of training? How we do create goals and how we plan to go after them? What is the purpose of practice and how should it be preparing us for the next big race? How do we visualize success both in training and competition? How do we work through the moments of self doubt? Or how we plan to come back from the injuries and bad races that are inevitable in sport? Check it out here to see what makes us tick and how you can use some of these same routines in your training.

**Nutrition**. Do you want a smoothie recipe for after a hard interval session that is both good tasting and good for you? How about breakfast options that fuel you up, but don’t overload your stomach? Or healthy and easy to make meals for lunch & dinner. We will have those recipes online and even some fun videos to watch where our athletes show you the way. Everything here has been used and tested by our team for years. These are recipes that have helped us to recover quicker from the demands of hard training and allow us to get back out the next day to do it again.

**Drills & Strength Training**. This is the one area where we get the most questions at clinics. What drills do we do, how do we do them, how often? What do we do in the gym? Sign up and take a look for yourself. Everything we show you here are exercises that we do in our own training. We show you our drill routines and how to do them. We show you all kinds of variations of gym work so that whether you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran there will be something here for you.

**AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING…**

This is Version 1 of our website. We will update it regularly and add in new content as we go. We know that this is just the start and we want you, our followers, to be a big part of how we move forward. Tell us what you want. Maybe it is training programs for high school runners over the summer? Maybe specific tutorial lessons online for coaches that don’t have access to live coaching clinics? Interviews with our athletes? More videos? Facebook or Instagram live? It is all on the table. We want to make this site about what you need to know most about running, both ours and your own.

**OF COURSE WE DIDN’T FORGET…**

There is always a call for team merchandise. We know this and definitely appreciate you wanting to support our brand and rep some team gear. This is in the works. We will work hard to keep this part of the site fresh with top quality product. Sign up for our newsletter or just subscribe to get a free running program and we will have you on our mailing list. Everyone on the list will get first notice to when the new stuff comes out.

**TO NEW BEGINNINGS…**

Thanks so much for riding with us on this journey. We hope you get everything out of your running and we really want to be a part of the process that makes it happen. We also thank you so much for your support over the years. Our athletes come from all over the United States and from around the world. It is important for us to make this place their second home. Your interaction with the team definitely helps make all those miles go by a lot easier.
