For the past few years I’ve been labeled “The Gay Runner.” And that’s great, really. Those are two things about me that I am actually quite proud of. I am proud of my sexuality and I’m proud of my running career. In fact, one of my main goals in 2019 was to really embrace being “The Gay Runner.” I made sure to wear a rainbow bracelet during every race, I became more vulnerable and honest on all my social platforms, and, after winning the adidas Boston Boost games last June, I proudly carried a pride flag on my shoulders.

I think being labeled as this has really helped me as an athlete. At every race, and on every start line, I’m motivated to show up for my community and put a show so that anyone who may need a queer role model has one in me. How do you put on a show in running? You win. And so this past year, I won. A lot. Winning was thrilling and exciting, but as the season progressed, the pressure to win began to wear me out. I was exhausted and overwhelmed. I had gotten so caught up in the idea that I had to win every race in order to make an impact that I lost sight of what being “The Gay Runner” was really about. I then realized that it was never about winning, and it wasn’t about losing either, it was about showing up and being seen.

At times last year showing up and being seen was actually quite terrifying and lonely. After winning the adidas boost games and being draped in a pride flag, adidas posted a photo of me in that pride flag to their 30 million followers on instagram. I remember my heart sinking while reading the thousands of comments. It was 2019 and the world was still filled with so much hate and homophobia. Then again, a month later, fear hit again. I had just finished top 3 in the US in the 1500m and was heading to represent Team USA at the World Championships. One of my first thoughts after qualifying wasn’t one of excitement, but rather fear. I was afraid I wasn’t going to be safe in Doha, Qatar, the host city for the championships and a country where homosexuality is illegal.

Before leaving for these World Championships, I was asked in an interview, “If you could magically snap your fingers and be straight, would you do it?” The question was a little jarring for a running interview, but it got me thinking.

I thought about how much easier my life would’ve been if I was born straight. I wouldn't have ever had to read the thousands of hateful comments directed towards me, fear would have never been one of the emotions I felt after qualifying for my first world team. I wouldn’t have experienced the internalized homophobia and deeply rooted hate I had for myself growing up. I could have lived without constantly being in fear of non-accepting people. I would have never felt the need to lie, sneak around, and jump through certain hoops just because I happen to love people of my same gender.

But then I thought about all the other things I wouldn’t have experienced if I was straight. I would’ve missed out on meeting a dad from Iowa who approached me at a track meet to tell me his teenage daughter had just come out to him because she saw me do it and realized she could too. I would’ve missed out on hearing from a young girl in Oklahoma who messaged me to say her parents didn’t allow her to follow me on social media but she wanted to reach out anyway and hoped she could one day be as out and as proud as I am. I would’ve missed out on a college teammate coming out to me, saying he knew it would be okay to attend Arkansas because if he was ever going to come out publicly, he knew the team would accept him because they had accepted me.

I thought about all my experiences, both good and bad, and gave my answer to the reporter. “No. No way. I can’t help that I was born this way, but I was, and though it’s been a long and sometimes difficult road, being gay is who I am and it’s something I am proud of. I wouldn't change for anything.”

There were plenty of times last year where I could have chosen to be less proud, or have a smaller social presence, or to take a step back from being “The Gay Runner.” I could have easily let the flow of hateful messages and experiences suppress who I wanted to be, but I never did. Instead, I allowed all of these experiences last year to teach me the value of visibility, to allow me to built confidence in my identity, and to ultimately help me find my voice. My goal for 2020 is to take my visibility a step further and make an even bigger difference. It’s time to use my voice and speak for those who don’t have one.

The original plan was to donate all of the prize money I earned in June (Pride Month) to The Trevor Project, an organization that focuses on suicide prevention efforts among LGBTQ+ youth. Due to COVID-19, 2020 hasn’t turned out the way many of us planned and the virus has disproportionately affected many across the world, especially those in vulnerable communities. During this pandemic, The Trevor Project has seen an increase of calls from suicidal LGBTQ+ youth. With COVID-19 also postponing and canceling all the meets I was planning to race in June, I have no prize money to donate and a smaller platform to be visible.

So I had a thought:

What if I put on a virtual race? A race that brings together the running community and the LGBTQ+ community. A race where all the proceeds go to the Trevor Project. A race where runners (and walkers!) can come together and run for love. A race for LGBTQ+ youth who deserve to know they are valued, seen, and loved by an entire community that is ready to run for them.

On June 28th, the last Sunday of Pride Month, [Golden Coast Track Club will be virtually hosting a Pride 5k](/training#pride-run). Registration is \$35 and 100% of the proceeds will go to The Trevor Project to help support LGBTQ+ youth. Upon registration you will receive an 8 week 5k training program, an adidas t-shirt, and race day sticker.

I believe in the midst of all this darkness and confusion, there are ways to find light and lean into hope. With everything going on in the world I think one of the most important things we can do is help others and really show up for those who need it most. Because right now, we need Love More Than Ever.
