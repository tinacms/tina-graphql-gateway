###### favorite thing about san diego?

I love the consistency in the weather because it provides a great training environment all year. It’s also wonderful to be so close to a beach because that’s my favorite place to unwind and relax.

###### favorite place to run in san diego?

My favorite spot is the trails up in Del Mar because the trail goes right along the beach and it has beautiful views!

###### who inspires you most?

Morgan Uceny was always my big inspiration through college and after. She was one of the reason I went to Boston in 2014 because I wanted the opportunity to grow and learn from her. I watched her overcome adversity and be truly herself. She found happiness inside and outside of the sport and did a great job of balancing life and running. It was awesome to have her as my role model during my first few years as a pro.

###### goal you are most excited about?

I’m really excited to chase down the Olympic standard this year. I have put in years of hard work on and off that track and I know I’m ready for that big PB!

###### favorite training day?

My favorite training day is usually our hard workout days. I love being challenged and seeing where there needs to be improvements. It provides me with my checklist to see how close I am to hitting my goals. Walking away from hard days is what makes me feel most accomplished and where I learn the most about myself.

###### favorite thing about gctc?

Life as a professional runner can be a little lonely, but one of the things that is so wonderful about this team is the positivity. Terrence and Jen foster a wonderful environment of lifting each other up and cheering each other on during great moments of success. Each member of the team wants everyone to succeed. I have worked with Terrence and Jen for 5+ years and I am constantly learning new information because they put generous amounts of time into the athletes.

###### accomplishment you are most proud of?

There are two moments this far that I am most proud of. My first is winning the US 1 mile road champs in 2018 because I made some big life changes during that year, but still found success. My second moment is running 4:05 in the summer of 2018 because I failed to make the US final that year, but came back to run a big PR after being really disappointed in myself.

###### Two truths and a lie

I hate cats

I failed my driver's test...twice
