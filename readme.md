## Managing License Headers

All _.js, _.ts, and \*.tsx files require a license header to be present.

### Add License

To add the license to a file, run the following command at the project root:

```bash
yarn license:add
```

This will search through the project for any files that requires a header and add it if it isn't already present.

### Delete License

To remove all license headers: at the project root run:

```bash
yarn license:delete
```

This will search the project for files that contain a license header and subsequently removes the header from them.

### Update License

When the license needs to be changed, first run the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
yarn license:delete
```

Then you may edit the **scripts/license.txt** file. Once complete, run the following command at the root of the project to add the new license to the required files:

```bash
yarn license:add
```
